## Brief Intro

</p> I am a self-taught fullstack software engineer, currently working an AI agent startup that interacts with the entire web headless. You find my most recent projects that I have worked on in my pinned repositories </p>

### Areas of Interest 

- I want to explore biotech and AI. I am deeply curious about the role AI can play as it pertains to synthetic blood and synthetic organs. Recently models I have sparked additionaly curisotiy. Here are a few of those links: https://github.com/HannesStark/boltzgen. 

- I have an wide range of curiosity of what future LLM's might look like. It's hard to make a specific description. All the obvious use-cases are public. I am dedicating a portion of my time in 2026 to training models for friends and their startups that might accelerate and improve their businesses.

</p> I will continue to use this as my personal portfolio with the sole focus bringing AI across multiple disciplinaries
